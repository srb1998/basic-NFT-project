# Simple NFT Project

Create my ERC721 based smart contract to create and mint 5 NFT for myself and deployed it on Rinkeby Testnet.
Contract Address for reference - 0xc04cabce4b78b81926afc3b39ccd1f1be6c5e841 (https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/sourabhs-nft)
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
